        This route is not secured by access token.
        Indeed, this route is used to retrieve server's clock when diagnosing clock drifting.
        If there is clock drift, token validation will fail because claims such as `nbf` will then
        be invalid, and thus prevent the clock drift diagnosis.

        This route primary function is to help with configuration diagnosis (e.g.: ID mismatch, hostname mismatch,

        provide configuration auto-filling, in order to assist the end user.

        It must be noted that this route will never return the whole configuration file as-is, for security reasons.

      summary: Mass-deletes recordings stored on this instance
      description: |-
        If you try to delete more than 50,000 recordings at once, you should split the list into multiple requests.
        Bigger payloads will be rejected with 413 Payload Too Large.

        The request processing consist in
        1) checking if one of the recording is active,
        2) counting the number of recordings not found on this instance.

        When a recording is not found on this instance, a counter is incremented.
        This number is returned as part of the response.
        You may use this information to detect anomalies on your side.
        For instance, this suggests the list of recordings on your side is out of date,
        and you may want re-index.
