///
/// - `connect_at`: When the connection attempt started (before DNS resolution)

///
/// For `ConnectFailure` events, `connect_at == disconnect_at` since no stream
/// was established.
///
/// # Byte Counting
///
/// - `bytes_tx`: Total bytes transmitted from local to remote peer
/// - `bytes_rx`: Total bytes received from remote to local peer
/// - Counts actual application data, not including protocol overhead
/// - Always 0 for `ConnectFailure` events
/// - May be 0 for successful connections with no data transfer
///
/// # Target Information
///
/// - `target_host`: Original host string from connection request (before DNS)
/// - `target_ip`: Concrete IP address (post-resolution or peer address)
/// - `target_port`: Target port number
///
/// DNS resolution failures result in no event emission since `target_ip`
/// cannot be determined. For multi-address hostnames (Happy Eyeballs),
/// ConnectFailure events use the IP of the last failed connection attempt.

/// to emit audit events. The callback is synchronous - consumers are responsible for
/// handling any async work (e.g., database writes, network calls) by using patterns
/// like `tokio::spawn` or message passing within their callback implementation.
///
/// # Exactly-Once Semantics
///
/// - Each JMUX stream generates exactly one audit event
/// - Events are emitted at stream cleanup time, not during operation
/// - Protected by atomic guards to prevent duplicate emission
/// - No aggregation - each event represents a single stream
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// The callback must be `Send + Sync + 'static` as it may be invoked from any
/// JMUX task context. Implementations should be efficient to avoid blocking
/// the JMUX event loop.
///
/// # Example Usage
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// let proxy = JmuxProxy::new(reader, writer)
///     .with_stream_event_callback(|event| {
///         // Log the event
///         log::info!("Stream {}: {} to {}:{}",
///             event.outcome, event.target_host, event.target_ip, event.port);
///         
///         // Handle async work in a spawned task
///         tokio::spawn(async move {
///             database.store_audit_event(event).await;
///         });
///     });
