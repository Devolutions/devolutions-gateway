# CI

This folder contains PowerShell scripts for CI, building, and packaging.

## Product Building Guide

- _build.ps1_ - wrapper around `cargo build` that saves to an output folder
  - handles all products and modules
- _copy-psmodule.ps1_ - copies the PowerShell module to a directory inside of `$Env:Temp`
- _package-gateway-windows.ps1_ - one-shot packaging the Gateway for Windows

## What is the difference between _Windows (regular)_ and _Windows (assembled)_?

_Windows (regular)_ is the "normal" build process where the MSI is built by WiX but not signed. This is used in _ci.yaml_. _Windows (assembled)_ is a two-step process where the `-Generate` flag is used to build supporting files for the MSI, including DLLs, language transforms, and _cmd_ scripts. The MSI is assembled in second step using _package-assembled.ps1_. The two-step approach is described [here](https://github.com/oleg-shilo/wixsharp/wiki/Developer's-Guide#compiling-wix-project).

## Dependencies

To build on Windows:
- WiX Toolset v3
