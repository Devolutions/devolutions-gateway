## Sample Usage

### Routing to a specific URL

1. Run WaykNow on 2 hosts to be able to open a wayk session between those 2 hosts.  
1.1 Download wayknow [here](https://wayk.devolutions.net/home/download)

2. Start devolutions-jet and specify the routing url where x.x.x.x is the IP of your wayk server host. You can easily get the host ip in the source id drop down list in WaykNow.
    ```
    $ cargo run -- -r tls://x.x.x.x:4489
    ```

3. On the same host where devolutions-jet is running, open wayk and connect to 127.0.0.1:8080 
    * The connection should start. A dummy certificate will be shown. You can accept it and the wayk connection should start.
